### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer 👨‍💻 with more than **10 years** of experience looking for best practices, clean code and above all sharing knowledge ⭐. My main language is Python 🐍 and Django; deploying projects in the cloud with AWS and GCP ☁️ thanks to Docker and Kubernetes 🚀. I have led teams of people under the SCRUM methodology ✔️. I am always looking to expand my knowledge by collaborating with people equally passionate about software engineering ❤️.
